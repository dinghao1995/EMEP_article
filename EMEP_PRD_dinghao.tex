% \begin{frame}{引言}
% \begin{EMEP/MSC-W模型简介}
珠三角地区作为我国经济最发达的地区之一，
EMEP(European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme)隶属于远距离跨界空气污染公约Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP)，
旨在解决跨界空气污染问题。该公约旗下包含5个EMEP中心，其中一个为坐落于挪威奥斯陆的MSC-W，该中心主要负责光化学氧化剂和气溶胶的模拟。
EMEP/MSC-W模型是由挪威气象局开发的化学传输模型（自1977年至今），最初EMEP/MSC-W模型以50KM*50KM的分辨率覆盖整个欧洲，
垂直方向上可从地面延伸到对流层顶（100hPa）。随着近十多年的发展，该模型已加入许多新的方案和模块，如：有机气溶胶方案，海盐的模拟，臭氧沉降，气溶胶沉降，边界层物理方案，土壤水的模拟等等。EMEP/MSC-W模型现已成为全球尺度的3D欧拉模型。

\section{结果与讨论}
\subsection{模拟结果验证}
\subsubsection{气象要素模拟结果验证}
% 丁浩整理撰写
通过目前的测试，本研究选取珠三角22个自动气象站作为观测数据的来源\ref{如图所示}。选取
地表气压值，2m温度值，10m风速值，相对湿度值等。。。作为需要验证的气象要素。
\subsubsection{污染物模拟结果验证}
% 丁浩整理撰写
通过目前的测试，本研究选取珠三角7个环境监测站作为观测数据的来源\ref{如图所示}。选取
SO2,NO2,CO,PM2.5,PM10,O3这6种常规污染物作为需要验证的污染物物种。
